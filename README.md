# INTELLIGENT-SEPARATION-OF-AMBIENT-SOUNDSIntelligent Separation and Filtering of Ambient Sounds Based on Recordable Vital Signs.
noise varies among individuals, it is not a specific frequency or type of sound. Furthermore, the perception of noise differs with changes in an individual's mood. Recently, no matter active or passive noise reduction products on the market, it is difficult to intelligently identify, separate and screen out the noise under the current mood. Therefore, an intelligent sound separation technology based on recordable vital signs is proposed. Without the proper devices, the scope of the study was to develop a prototype software system that would process incoming audio signals and vital signs, perform intelligent filtering and matching, and feed back to the system's users. The proposed Optimal Feature Filtering and Mapping (OFFAM) framework separates and filters ambient sounds under the current vital signs in a probabilistic way for the user to select and sort, where the features are extracted from the audio signals and vital signs by using the autoencoders, blind source separation algorithms. All programs are implemented in MATLAB.
